I have built a simple Decision Tree classifier model using the "Iris.csv" data set for predicting species based upon number of parameters. This project is organized as follows: (a) importing of libraries; (b) importing the dataset; (c) Getting information about the dataset i.e. Checking of Missing values/Outliers; (d) Basic EDA and vizualization ; (e) basic decision tree model; (c); (f) model validation and (g) building the tree.
Iris: file for the dataset used for model building.
Task 2.ipynb: the jupyter notebook containing code.
